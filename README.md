# batch_convert

**Mostly done**

**Description**

A Command Line Interface (CLI) for batch converting all video files in a file structure into a given format (extension).

**Motivation**

When you just sat down in the sofa in front of the TV with a cup of something hot and some good snacks, you don't want to get up again. But you have to when it turns out the file you wanted to see from your Netowrk Attatched Storage (NAS) was in a format Chromecast does not support, leading to the following image:

Seeing this picture ruins the mood. You would then have to go get a laptop, and HDMI cable and play it from there, or simthing similarly less convinient than just casting it.
But no more! 

What if I simply converted all videofiles into .mp4 or another compatible format ? 

**Features**

**Possible Future Features**

Possible additional feature: folder watch. Automatically transcode all files in given folder.
